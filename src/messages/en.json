    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "sampleQ1Title": "What is AegisPad now?",
    "sampleQ1Content": "AegisPad is an intelligent tool that helps you refine and translate content, and prepare it for publishing on HIVE, using the power of Gemini AI and securing your Gemini API key with Hive Keychain.",
    "sampleQ2Title": "How do I get a Gemini API Key?",
    "sampleQ2Content": "You can get a Gemini API Key for free from Google AI Studio. AegisPad uses this key to power its AI features. The free tier offers a generous amount of tokens for content revision and translations.",
    "sampleQ3Title": "How is my Gemini API key stored?",
    "sampleQ3Content": "Your Gemini API key, once provided, is encrypted using your Hive Keychain account (specifically, your Posting key) and stored locally in your browser's local storage. It is decrypted only when needed to interact with the Gemini API and is never sent to our servers unencrypted.",
    "geminiApiUsageQuestion": "How are tokens or the cost of using AI handled?",
    "geminiApiUsageAnswer": "Using AI features consumes tokens from your Gemini API key, and any associated costs are based on Google's pricing policy for the Gemini API. AegisPad attempts to display token usage to help you monitor this, but the ultimate responsibility for managing your API key usage and costs lies with you.",
    "supportedLanguagesQuestion": "In what languages can I revise, and translate articles?",
    "supportedLanguagesAnswer": "Article revision and translation can be performed in multiple languages, depending on Gemini's capabilities.",
    "articleRevisionProcessQuestion": "How does article revision work?",
    "articleRevisionProcessAnswer": "The AI reviews your article for grammar, style, clarity, and flow. It aims to provide an improved version while attempting to maintain the original Markdown formatting.",
    "workSavingQuestion": "Is my work saved automatically?",
    "workSavingAnswer": "Currently, on the 'Final Review' page, you can use the 'Save for Later' option, which saves your article to your browser's local storage. Please note this is temporary. Saving articles to the cloud or a database for more permanent storage is a planned future feature.",
    "hivePublishingQuestion": "Can I publish directly to Hive from AegisPad?",
    "hivePublishingAnswer": "The 'Publish to Hive' feature is planned and under development. For now, it serves as a placeholder, and direct publishing to Hive is not yet enabled.",
    "betaFeedbackQuestion": "This is a Beta version, how can I provide feedback or report bugs?",
    "betaFeedbackAnswer": "We highly value your input! You can share your thoughts, suggestions, or report any issues you encounter by visiting our Feedback page. You'll find a link to it in the website header.",
    "betaVersionMeaningQuestion": "What does it mean that the application is in Beta?",
    "betaVersionMeaningAnswer": "Being in Beta means AegisPad is in an early stage of release. You might encounter some bugs or find that some features are not yet fully implemented. Your feedback during this phase is crucial for us to improve the application.",
    "dataPrivacyQuestion": "Where are my articles and API key stored?",
    "dataPrivacyAnswer": "Your Gemini API key is encrypted using your HIVE account credentials and stored in our secure database, linked to your profile. If you use the 'Save for Later' feature on the 'Final Review' page, your article content is temporarily stored in your browser's local storage."
