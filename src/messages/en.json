    "whatIsAegisPadQuestion": "What is AegisPad and who is it for?",
    "whatIsAegisPadAnswer": "AegisPad is an advanced AI-powered Markdown editor designed for bloggers and content creators on the Hive blockchain. Our goal is to unify all the tools you need to efficiently create, refine, and publish your content, saving you time and effort.",
    "aiAssistanceQuestion": "How does Artificial Intelligence help me in AegisPad?",
    "aiAssistanceAnswer": "AegisPad integrates AI (currently Google's Gemini) to assist you with various tasks such as revising your articles to improve grammar and style, translating your content into multiple languages, and generating ideas or initial drafts for your posts. All of this is integrated so you don't need to configure external API keys.",
    "hiveAccountRequirementQuestion": "Do I need a Hive account to use AegisPad?",
    "hiveAccountRequirementAnswer": "Yes, to log in, publish content on the Hive blockchain, and take full advantage of AegisPad's features, you will need a Hive account and the Hive Keychain extension installed in your browser. Hive Keychain ensures that your private keys never leave your control.",
    "beneficiaryModelQuestion": "How does AegisPad's beneficiary model work?",
    "beneficiaryModelAnswer": "AegisPad is a project that aims to grow with its community. To help maintain and develop the platform, 6% of the rewards generated by your publications made through AegisPad are assigned as a beneficiary to the @aegispad account. This allows us to continue offering you innovative tools and quality service.",
    "supportedLanguagesQuestion": "What languages are supported for AI assistance?",
    "supportedLanguagesAnswer": "AegisPad's AI can assist with content in many languages. For translation, you can translate to and from a wide variety of languages including Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, Korean, Arabic, and English, among others. The revision and creation tools also support multiple languages.",
    "articleRevisionProcessQuestion": "How does the article revision process work?",
    "articleRevisionProcessAnswer": "You can submit your article text to our AI for revision. It will analyze your content and suggest improvements in grammar, style, clarity, and coherence. You'll then be able to review these suggestions line by line and decide which ones to apply.",
    "workSavingQuestion": "Is my work saved automatically?",
    "workSavingAnswer": "AegisPad automatically saves your work in progress (title and content) in your browser's local storage. This means if you accidentally close the tab or your browser, you can usually recover your work when you return. However, for important pieces, we always recommend also saving a copy externally.",
    "hivePublishingQuestion": "How does publishing to Hive work?",
    "hivePublishingAnswer": "Once you're satisfied with your article, you can proceed to the final review page. There, you can set your title, tags (including the main community tag), and then publish directly to the Hive blockchain using Hive Keychain for secure transaction signing. AegisPad helps streamline this process.",
    "betaFeedbackQuestion": "How can I provide feedback during the beta phase?",
    "betaFeedbackAnswer": "Your feedback is invaluable to us! You can share your thoughts, suggestions, or report any issues through the 'Feedback' link معمولاً in the application's footer or navigation. We appreciate your help in making AegisPad better.",
    "betaVersionMeaningQuestion": "What does it mean that AegisPad is in Beta?",
    "betaVersionMeaningAnswer": "Being in Beta means AegisPad is actively under development and testing. While we strive for a stable experience, you might encounter occasional bugs or a feature might not be fully polished. We're continuously working to improve and add new functionalities based on user feedback.",
    "dataPrivacyQuestion": "How is my data and privacy handled?",
    "dataPrivacyAnswer": "We take your privacy seriously. Your article content is processed by AI services only when you explicitly use an AI feature (like revise or translate). Authentication is handled via Hive Keychain, meaning your Hive keys are never exposed to AegisPad. We store your Hive username and encrypted API keys (if you chose to provide one in the past, though now we use a master key) securely. For more details, please refer to our Privacy Policy (link to be added).",
    "customizationQuestion": "Can I customize my experience in AegisPad?",
    "customizationAnswer": "Yes! You can customize some aspects of your AegisPad experience, such as the visual theme (light, dark, or your system default) and the page you are redirected to after logging in. These options are available on your profile page.",
    "blogVsCommunityPostQuestion": "What's the difference between posting to my blog and a community?",
    "blogVsCommunityPostAnswer": "When you post to your personal blog, the content primarily appears on your profile. When posting to a community, your post is associated with that thematic space, increasing its visibility among members interested in that niche. AegisPad allows you to easily choose where to publish, using the selected community as the main tag (category) for your post.",
    "devlogsQuestion": "Where can I see the project's development history or changelog?",
